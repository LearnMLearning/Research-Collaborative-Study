## DaRe
We conduct our experiments on 13 publicly- available datasets that represent problems well-suited for tree-based models, and one synthetic dataset we call Synthetic.
For each dataset, we generate one-hot encodings for any categorical variable and leave all numeric and binary variables as is. For any dataset without a designated train and test split, we randomly sample 80% of the data for training and use the rest for testing.
A summary of the datasets is in Table 1, and additional dataset details are in the Appendix: Â§B.1.
