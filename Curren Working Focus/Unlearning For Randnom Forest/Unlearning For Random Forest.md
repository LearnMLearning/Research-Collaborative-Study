## DaRe
13 publicly-available datasets, 1 synthetic dataset we call Synthetic.
For each dataset, we generate **one-hot encodings** for any categorical variable and leave all numeric and binary variables as is. For any dataset without a designated train and test split, we **randomly** sample **80%** of the data for training and use the rest for testing.

A summary of the datasets is in Table 1, and additional dataset details are in the Appendix: Â§B.1.
