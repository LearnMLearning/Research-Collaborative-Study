- Vaccine (Bull et.al., 2016; DrivenData, 2019) contains 26,707 survey responses, which were collected between October 2009 and June 2010. The survey asked people 36 behavioral and personal questions, indicating 36 attributes, and ultimately asking them whether or not they got an H1N1 and/or seasonal flue vaccine. We aim to determine whether a person received a seasonal flu vaccine.

- Synthetic (Pedregosa et al., 2011) contains 1,000,000 instances normally distributed about the vertices of a 5-dimensional hypercube into 2 clusters per class. There are 5 informative attributes, 5 redundant attributes, and 30 useless attributes. There is interdependence between these attributes, and a randomly selected 5% of the labels are flipped to increase the difficulty of the classification task.

- Higgs (Baldi et al., 2014; Dua & Graff, 2019) contains 11,000,000 signal processes (5,829,123 Higgs bosons) characterized by 22 kinematic properties measured by detectors in a particle accelerator and 7 attributes derived from those properties. The goal is to distinguish between a background signal process and a Higgs bosons process. http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml
