Purchase \citep {misc_online_shoppers_purchasing_intention_dataset_468, Dua:2019} is primarily used to predict online shopping intentions. The goal of this dataset is to build a binary classification model to determine whether users have the intention to complete a transaction. The dataset includes two types of features: numerical features and categorical features which are used to analyze user behavior and predict their purchasing intentions.

Vaccine \citep{Bull2016, DrivenData2019} is data set for the competition "Flu Shot Learning: Predict H1N1 and Seasonal Flu Vaccines" in Drivendata. It contains 26,707 survey responses, which were collected between October 2009 and June 2010. The survey asked people 36 behavioral and personal questions, indicating 36 attributes, and ultimately asking them whether or not they got an H1N1 and/or seasonal flue vaccine. We aim to determine whether a person received a seasonal flu vaccine.

Adult \citep{misc_adult_2, Dua:2019} is extracted from the 1994 Census database by Barry Becker. It consists of 48,842 instances of 14 attributes and the target variable denotes whether the a person's personal income level is more than $50K per year or not.

Bank \citep{MORO201422, Dua:2019} is related with direct marketing campaigns (phone calls) of a Portuguese banking institution dated from May 2008 to November 2010. The classification goal is to predict if the client will subscribe a term deposit.

Heart \cite{Kaggle2018} is the data provided by Svetlana Ulianova on Kaggle. It contains 70,000 patient records comprised of 11 attributes (five numerical and six categorical measurements) with respect to cardiovascular diseases, and the target variable denotes the presence of a heart disease.

Diabetes \citep{[https://doi.org/10.1155/2014/781670](https://doi.org/10.1155/2014/781670), Dua:2019} encompasses a decade (1999-2008) of clinical care information from 130 hospitals across the United States. This dataset includes records of patients diagnosed with diabetes, covering laboratory results, medications, and hospital stays of up to 14 days. The primary goal is to predict whether a patient will be readmitted within 30 days of discharge.

- NoShow \cite{Kaggle2016} consists of 110,527 intances of patient attendences formedical appointments comprised of 14 attributes and the target variable denotes whether or not a patient shows up to their doctors' appointment.

- Synthetic \cite{pedregosa2011scikit} consists 1,000,000 instances normally distributed about the vertices of a 5-dimensional hypercube into 2 clusters per class. There are 40 attributes (five informative, five redundant, and thirty useless). There is interdependence between these attributes, and a randomly selected 5% of the labels are flipped to increase the difficulty of the classification task.

Higgs \citep{Baldi2014, Dua:2019} consists of 11,000,000 signal processes characterized by 22 kinematic properties measured by detectors in a particle accelerator and 7 attributes derived from those properties. Our aim is to distinguish between a background signal process and a Higgs bosons process.
