- Purchase (.)
This dataset contains 210K data points in ten numerical and seven categorical attributes about browsing behavior in 12,330 individual sessions of an online shop, and the target variable denotes whether the session ended in a purchase or not.

- Vaccine  (Bull et al., 2016; DrivenData, 2019) consists of 26,707 survey responses collected between October 2009 and June 2010 asking people a range of 36 behavioral and personal questions, and ultimately asking whether or not they got an H1N1 and/or seasonal flu vaccine. Our aim is to predict whether or not a person received a seasonal flu vaccine.

- Synthetic (Pedregosa et al., 2011) contains 1,000,000 instances normally distributed about the vertices of a 5-dimensional hypercube into 2 clusters per class. There are 5 informative attributes, 5 redundant attributes, and 30 useless attributes. There is interdependence between these attributes, and a randomly selected 5% of the labels are flipped to increase the difficulty of the classification task.

- Higgs (Baldi et al., 2014; Dua & Graff, 2019) contains 11,000,000 signal processes (5,829,123 Higgs bosons) characterized by 22 kinematic properties measured by detectors in a particle accelerator and 7 attributes derived from those properties. The goal is to distinguish between a background signal process and a Higgs bosons process. http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml
