Census Definition

The Census Bureau uses a set of money income thresholds that vary by family size and composition (age of family members) to determine who is in poverty. If a family's total income is less than the family's threshold, then that family and every individual in it is considered in poverty.

relative property

Rank-order all the people in the community based on their income, then you draw a line at 10-20% and everybody below that line is considered to be poor  
  
A poor person is a person who cannot afford living up to community standards
